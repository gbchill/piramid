# Piramid Dashboard

**Status:** Coming Soon

The dashboard is currently a placeholder while we focus on completing the core Rust engine.

## Running

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development server (port 3000)
npm run dev
```

## What's Here Now

A simple "Coming Soon" page that displays:
- Piramid branding
- Status message
- Link to REST API documentation

## Future Plans

Once the core Rust engine is complete, this will be rebuilt as a full-featured management UI with:
- Collection management
- Vector search playground
- Real-time metrics
- Embedding tools
- Data visualization

For now, interact with Piramid via the REST API at `http://localhost:6333/api`
