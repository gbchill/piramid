//! In a web server, you need to share data across requests.
//! But HTTP is stateless - each request is independent.
//! 
//! Solution: wrap shared data in `Arc<T>` (atomic reference counting)
//! so multiple threads can share ownership safely.
//!
//! For mutable shared data, we also need `RwLock` or `Mutex`:
//! - `Mutex` = one reader OR one writer at a time
//! - `RwLock` = many readers OR one writer (better for read-heavy workloads)
