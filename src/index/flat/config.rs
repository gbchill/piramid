// Flat index configuration
// This struct defines the configuration options for a flat index, which is a simple type of vector index that stores all vectors in a single list and performs linear search. The configuration includes the distance metric to use for similarity calculations (e.g., cosine, euclidean) and the execution mode (e.g., auto, single-threaded, multi-threaded). The default configuration uses cosine similarity and automatic execution mode.
