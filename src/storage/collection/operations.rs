// Collection CRUD operations
// This module implements the core CRUD operations for the collection, including get, insert, delete, and update. These operations interact with the underlying storage layer to read and write documents, update the index and vector index, and manage the in-memory caches. The insert and delete operations also log changes to the WAL for durability and recovery purposes. The update operations allow for modifying either the metadata or the vector of an existing document while ensuring that the changes are properly persisted and reflected in the index and caches.
