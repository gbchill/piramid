// JIT-optimized Euclidean distance
// this works but is not as fast as the dot product version, likely due to the extra sqrt and more
// complex math. Still faster than the non-jit version though.
// it is basically the same as the dot product jit but with the subtraction and squaring instead of
// multiplication when we pass into this function a and b where a is the query vector and b is the
// database vector, then we are computing the distance between them, which is sqrt(sum((a[i] -
// b[i])^2)) by first computing the sum of squares of differences and then taking the square root
// at the end. The reason we have the separate function for squared distance is that sometimes we
// only care about the relative distances and can skip the sqrt for better performance, and also to
// avoid the overhead of the sqrt when we are doing a lot of distance comparisons and only care
// about which one is smaller, not the actual distance value.
