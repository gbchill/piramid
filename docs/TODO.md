### Future Considerations

**Advanced Search**

[ ] Recommendation API (similar to these IDs, not those)

[ ] Grouped/diverse search (max results per category)

[ ] Scroll/pagination for large result sets

[ ] Metadata-only search (no vector similarity)

[ ] Vector similarity between two stored vectors

[ ] Vector count per metadata filter

[ ] SQL integration

**Data Import/Export**

[ ] Import from JSON/CSV/Parquet

[ ] Export to JSON/CSV/Parquet

[ ] Streaming import for large datasets

[ ] Import progress tracking

[ ] Format validation on import

**Additional Features**

[ ] Corrupted file detection + auto-repair

[ ] Automatic index rebuild on corruption

[ ] Circuit breaker for embedding API failures

[ ] Soft delete with cleanup

[ ] Collection aliases

[ ] Move collection between directories

[ ] Verbose debug logging mode

[ ] CLI 

[ ] Client side distributed Systems

**MCP Integration**

[ ] MCP server implementation

[ ] Tools: search_similar, get_document, list_collections, add_document

[ ] Agent-friendly responses (structured JSON-LD)

### [Zipy](https://github.com/ashworks1706/zipy) development begins

**Zipy Integration (GPU Acceleration)**

[ ] Dependency Integration: Add zipy crate to Cargo.toml as an optional feature.

[ ] Compute Backend Enum: Refactor ExecutionMode to support Zipy(Arc<ZipyEngine>) variant.

[ ] Startup Handshake: Implement logic to attempt Zipy initialization on boot and fallback to CPU if failed.

[ ] VRAM Hydration: Utility to load existing on-disk vectors into GPU VRAM on startup.

[ ] Dual-Write Architecture: Ensure insert_vector writes to both Disk (Persistence) and Zipy (VRAM).

[ ] Search Router: Implement logic to route POST /search requests to Zipy when active.

[ ] Fallback Circuit Breaker: Auto-switch to CPU search if Zipy returns OOM or timeout errors.

[ ] Health Check Extension: Add GPU status (temperature, memory usage) to /api/health.
