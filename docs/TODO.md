[ ] Slow query alerts

### Future Considerations

**Additional Features**

[ ] Corrupted file detection + auto-repair

[ ] Automatic index rebuild on corruption

[ ] Fallback to brute-force search if HNSW fails

[ ] Circuit breaker for embedding API failures

[ ] Soft delete with cleanup

[ ] Collection aliases

[ ] Hot reload configuration

[ ] Move collection between directories

[ ] Development mode with auto-reload

[ ] Verbose debug logging mode


**MCP Integration**

### [Zipy](https://github.com/ashworks1706/zipy) development begins

**Zipy Integration (GPU Acceleration)**

[ ] Dependency Integration: Add zipy crate to Cargo.toml as an optional feature.

[ ] Compute Backend Enum: Refactor ExecutionMode to support Zipy(Arc<ZipyEngine>) variant.

[ ] Startup Handshake: Implement logic to attempt Zipy initialization on boot and fallback to CPU if failed.

[ ] VRAM Hydration: Utility to load existing on-disk vectors into GPU VRAM on startup.

[ ] Dual-Write Architecture: Ensure `insert_vector` writes to both Disk (Persistence) and Zipy (VRAM).

[ ] Search Router: Implement logic to route `POST /search` requests to Zipy when active.

[ ] Fallback Circuit Breaker: Auto-switch to CPU search if Zipy returns OOM or timeout errors.

[ ] Health Check Extension: Add GPU status (temperature, memory usage) to `/api/health`.
