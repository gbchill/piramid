# Health & Metrics

TODO cover:
- Endpoints: /health, /health/embeddings, /readyz, /api/metrics.
- What readiness checks: storage loaded, rebuild jobs, disk guard status, embedding availability.
- Key metrics to watch: latency, lock timings, cache sizes, limits, disk/memory guards.
- How to consume metrics (Prometheus scrape or curl examples).
