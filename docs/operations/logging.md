# Logging & Tracing

TODO cover:
- Logging stack: tracing levels, HTTP TraceLayer, request IDs, where output goes by default.
- How to enable verbose debug/trace; suggested filters/env vars.
- What is logged on startup vs. per-request; slow query threshold if applicable.
- Guidance on adding structured fields (collection, id, elapsed_ms, etc.).
