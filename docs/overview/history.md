# History and milestones

TODO outline:
- Early motivation: GPU co-location with LLM, avoiding CPU round-trips.
- First milestones: storage layout, mmap + WAL, Flat then HNSW/IVF.
- Major refactors: collection builder, cache rebuilds, limits/guards, CLI unification.
- Current state vs. future (Zipy kernel) and steps to reach GPU target.
